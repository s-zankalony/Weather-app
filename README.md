## The start
This project was mainly created by YouTube channel [@GreatStackDev](https://www.youtube.com/@GreatStackDev)
Here is the creation video [How To Make Weather App Using JavaScript Step By Step Explained
](https://youtu.be/MIYQR-Ybrn4?si=r2wyIuRkS37nZYFV)
It was great video to learn vanilla JavaScript, it was my first time to learn how to use APIs thanks!

## The final project
After learning how to use Node.js, I wanted to try to convert it to Node.js project. it's my first time to try creating Node.js project on my own, I've stumbled a lot & used Chatgpt  many times, but finally it worked!
